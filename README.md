This is a Unofficial compat-wireless source for TIwlan 12xx chips with 3.4 kernel roms since Texas Instruments have officially abandoned the chipset without further support,
i've compiled it using their official compat & compat-wireless-r8.a6.06 along with their latest R5.SP7.01 drivers..its been tested by me everything works flawlessly..
